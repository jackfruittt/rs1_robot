\hypertarget{index_overview}{}\doxysection{Overview}\label{index_overview}
This package contains the relevant source code for our drone swarm model and its nodes that allow it to operate fully autonomously. This is 1 of 4 packages used for Robotics Studio 1.

The nodes this package contains is relevant for mission planning, path-\/planning and autonomous navigation and control. This package does not contain any perception code, that is in the rs1\+\_\+perception package.\hypertarget{index_features}{}\doxysection{Key Features}\label{index_features}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Autonomous Flight Control}}\+: Complete takeoff, flight, and landing control
\item {\bfseries{Decentralised Swarm}}\+: Swarm is decentralised and drones are able to communicate with each other for peer discovery
\item {\bfseries{Obstacle Detection}}\+: 360-\/degree laser scanning for obstacle avoidance
\item {\bfseries{Path Planning}}\+: Using a combination of default routes and randomly generated waypoints the drones are fully autonomous
\item {\bfseries{Altitude Control}}\+: Altitude Control + Obstaclew detection allows for collision free navigation
\item {\bfseries{Dynamic and Scalable}}\+: Dynamic gazebo bridge allows as many drones to be spawned, no hard coded maximum
\item {\bfseries{ROS2 Integration}}\+: Full ROS2 component-\/based software engineering framework
\item {\bfseries{Composed Nodes}}\+: Nodes in rs1\+\_\+robot are composed. This ensures high speed communication and optimised performance for our swarm

The system consists of two main ROS2 nodes\+:\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysubsubsection{Drone Node}\label{index_autotoc_md0}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Main control node managing ROS related drone operations
\item Handles drone control (flight control, PID, alititude control, sensor detection)
\item Implements obstacle avoidance algorithms
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsubsection{Mission Node}\label{index_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Plans missions for all drones
\item Enables peer discovery for drone response co-\/ordination
\item Responsible for waypoint planning used for autonomous navigation
\item Contains detailed state machine with service-\/based response executors for handling various scenario response
